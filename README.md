# AutofacDI
This is just a playground for trying out ideas on using AutoFac for Dependancy Injection
in a multi project type solution, e.g. MVC, Web API and multiple class libraries. 
Just playing around with ideas of how to get the various NuGet packages installed and 
working complete with a Test project using the concept of a Configuration Base to ensure 
there is only one place in the whole application that knows about the use of a DI Container, 
and that place is responsible for wiring up all concrete classes.
